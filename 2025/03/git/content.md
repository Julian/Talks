`git` is a piece of software designed to help collaboratively work on an ongoing project, known as a **repository**.

<!-- pause -->
Often this repository is a piece of software, but it can really be anything.

<!-- pause -->

It helps you maintain *versions* of what you're working on, which it maintains forever, and helps groups of people from 1 to 2 to 10 to 100,000 concurrently work on the project with minimal friction.

<!-- pause -->

GitHub is a website which will host `git` repositories and which adds additional functionality to help with collaboration and discoverability.
It's sort of a social media for `git` repositories.

# Why learn how to do this?

<!-- new_lines: 4 -->

* Something you use is developed on GitHub and you want to report a bug or help fix one

<!-- new_lines: 2 -->

<!-- pause -->

* You want to create something in public and may (or may not) hope to attract others with similar interests
<!-- new_lines: 2 -->

<!-- pause -->

* To take advantage of free computational resources (via GitHub Actions)

Main goal
===

# Know how to:

* Send a *pull request* to a project on GitHub

<!-- pause -->

<!-- new_lines: 2 -->

* Decide whether to use `git` and GitHub for a collaborative project

```
  easier to use
  less functionality
↑ further away from what's "really" happening
|
|→  GitHub.com interface
|
|→  GitHub Desktop
|
|→  Visual Studio Code's git support
|
|→  `git` command line
|
↓ more functionality
  less training wheels
  closer to what's "really" happening
```
